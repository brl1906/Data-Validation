    "0. for the first year of the new measure determine a standard for each problem type by taking the average of the duration of that PM type for each year over the last 3 fiscal years: fy16,fy17,fy18. After determining the average duration for each year for each PM type, get the median value of the average durations for each problem type for the last 3 years. (The median or midpoint is used here primarily for two reasons: 1. the division was unable to conduct--as broad as desired--a private and public comparitive study of maintenance practices to determine if and what the industry standard is for each of the pm types in use at FMD and therefore chose to start using historial performance, 2. because using the average would make the standard--and therefore the measure--too heavily influenced by outliers we are using the midpoint.)  For example the below dataset labeled 'distributionA' has 27 observations and an average of 24 but a median of 9; setting a standard based on the average of this data would mean at worst, the outliers help reward and promote under performance or at best, the outliers would result in a measure insufficient for turning the curve. \n",
